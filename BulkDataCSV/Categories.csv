1,Whisky,"A type of liquor made from fermented grain mash. Various grains (which may be malted) are used for different varieties, including barley, corn, rye, and wheat. Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, which are typically made of charred white oak.",,1
2,Rye Whisky,"American Rye whiskey is, by law, made from a mash of at least 51 percent rye. (The other ingredients in the mash are usually corn and malted barley.) It is distilled to no more than 160 U.S. proof (80% abv) and aged in charred, new oak barrels. The whiskey must be put in the barrels at no more than 125 proof (62.5% abv). ",,1
3,Straight Whisky,"Whiskey that has been aged for at least two years and has not been blended with other spirits may be further designated as straight, as in ""straight whiskey"".",,1
4,Tennesee Whisky,All current Tennessee whiskey producers are required by Tennessee law to produce their whiskeys in Tennessee and to use a filtering step known as the Lincoln County Process prior to aging the whiskey.,,1
5,Bourbon Whisky,"A whiskey produced in the U.S. and it's territories made from a grain mixture that is at least 51% corn and aged in new, charred oak containers. Bourbon is distilled to no more than 160 (U.S.) proof (80% alcohol by volume) and entered into the container for aging at no more than 125 proof (62.5% alcohol by volume). It is then
bottled at 80 proof or more (40% alcohol by volume).",,1
6,Irish Whisky,"A whiskey distilled and matured on the island of Ireland (comprising the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland) from a mash of malted cereals with or without whole grains of other cereals and which has been: Saccharified by the diastase of malt contained therein, with or without other natural enzymes; Fermented by the action of yeast; Distilled at an alcoholic strength of less than 94.8% alcohol by volume in such a way that the distillate has an aroma and taste derived from the materials used and only plain water and caramel colour is added to it; Subject to the maturation of the final distillate for at least three years in wooden casks, such as oak, not exceeding 700 litres (185 US gal; 154 imp gal) capacity; Retain the colour, aroma and taste derived from the production process referred to previously; And must have a minimum alcoholic by volume content of 40%. Individual technical specifications for the three varieties of Irish whiskey, ""single pot still"", ""single malt"", ""single grain"", plus ""blended"" whiskey (a mix of two or more of these varieties) are also outlined in the technical file.[39] The use of the term ""single"" in the aforementioned varieties being permissible only if the whiskey is totally distilled on the site of a single distillery.",,1
7,Canadian Whisky,"A type of whisky produced in Canada. Most Canadian whiskies are blended multi-grain liquors containing a large percentage of corn spirits, and are typically lighter and smoother than other whisky styles. When Canadian distillers began adding small amounts of highly-flavourful rye grain to their mashes, people began demanding this new rye-flavoured whisky, referring to it simply as ""rye"". Today, as for the past two centuries, the terms ""rye whisky"" and ""Canadian whisky"" are used interchangeably in Canada and (as defined in Canadian law) refer to exactly the same product, which generally is made with only a small amount of rye grain.",,1
8,Japanese Whisky,"A style of whisky developed and produced in Japan. Whisky production in Japan began around 1870, but the first commercial production was in 1923 upon the opening of the country's first distillery, Yamazaki. Broadly speaking, the style of Japanese whisky is more similar to that of Scotch whisky than other major styles of whisky.",,1
9,Scotch Whisky,"Is malt whisky or grain whisky (or a blend of the two), made in Scotland. All Scotch whisky must be aged immediately after distillation in oak barrels for at least three years.[5][6] Any age statement on a bottle of Scotch whisky, expressed in numerical form, must reflect the age of the youngest whisky used to create that product. A whisky with an age statement is known as guaranteed-age whisky. A whisky without an age statement is known as a no age statement (NAS) whisky, the only guarantee being that all whisky contained in that bottle is at least three years old. The minimum bottling strength according to existing regulations is 40% alcohol by volume. Scotch whisky is divided into five distinct categories: single malt Scotch whisky, single grain Scotch whisky, blended malt Scotch whisky (formerly called ""vatted malt"" or ""pure malt""), blended grain Scotch whisky, and blended Scotch whisky. Some distilleries use a peat fire to dry the barley for some of their products before grinding it and making the mash. Peat smoke contributes phenolic compounds, such as guaiacol, that give aromas similar to smoke. ",,1
10,Blended Whisky,"The product of blending different types of whiskeys and sometimes also neutral spirits, colorings, and flavorings. It is generally the product of mixing one or more higher-quality straight or single malt whiskey with less expensive spirits and other ingredients. This typically allows for a lower priced finished product, although expensive ""premium"" varieties also exist.",,1
11,Single Malt Whisky,Malt whisky from a single distillery.,,1
12,Single Pot Still Whisky,"A style of Irish whiskey made by a single distillery from a mixed mash of malted and unmalted barley distilled in a pot still. Somewhat similar to single malt whiskey, the style is defined by its inclusion of unmalted raw barley in the mash in addition to malt. However, small amounts of raw oats or wheat may have been used at times.[2] This unmalted component is said to give the pot still whiskey a ""spicier bristle"" and ""thicker texture"" than the otherwise similar malt whiskeys. If the whiskey is not distilled completely on the site of a single distillery, then it may be termed pot still whiskey but not single pot still whiskey.",,1
13,Grain Whisky,"Normally refers to any whisky made, at least in part from grains other than malted barley. Frequently used grains include maize, wheat, and rye. Grain whiskies usually contain some malted barley to provide enzymes needed for mashing and are required to include it if they are produced in Ireland or Scotland.",,1
14,Malt Whisky,Whisky made from a fermented mash consisting of malted barley.,,1
15,Agave,"Maguey is a Spanish word that refers to all of the large-leafed plants in the Asparagaceae family, including agaves and yuccas. Agave is a genus of monocots native to the arid regions of the Americas. The genus is primarily known for its succulent and xerophytic species that typically form large rosettes of strong, fleshy leaves.",,1
16,Tequila,"Made from the blue agave plant, primarily in the area surrounding the city of Tequila 65 km (40 mi) northwest of Guadalajara, and in the Jaliscan Highlands (Los Altos de Jalisco) of the central western Mexican state of Jalisco. Mexican laws state that tequila can be produced only in the state of Jalisco and limited municipalities in the states of Guanajuato, Michoacán, Nayarit, and Tamaulipas.",,1
17,Blanco Tequila,"White spirit, unaged and bottled or stored immediately after distillation, or aged less than two months in stainless steel or neutral oak barrels",,1
18,Reposado Tequila,"Aged a minimum of two months, but less than a year in oak barrels of any size",,1
19,Anejo Tequila,"Aged a minimum of one year, but less than three years in small oak barrels",,1
20,Extra Anejo Tequila,Aged a minimum of three years in oak barrels; this category was established in March 2006.,,1
21,Mezcal,"Made from the heart of the agave/maguey plant, called the piña, in much the same way as it was 200 years ago. In Mexico, mezcal is generally consumed straight and has a strong smoky flavor. The process begins by harvesting the plants, which can weigh 40 kg (88 pounds) each, and extracting the piña by cutting off the plant's leaves and roots. The piñas are then cooked for about three days, often in pit ovens, which are earthen mounds over pits of hot rocks. This underground roasting gives mezcal its intense and distinctive smoky flavor. They are then crushed and mashed (traditionally by a stone wheel turned by a horse) and then left to ferment in large vats or barrels with water added. The mash is allowed to ferment, the resulting liquid collected and distilled in either clay or copper pots which will further modify the flavor of the final product.",,1
22,Sotol,"From the Chihuahuan desert (northern Mexico, western Texas) sourced from the plants of the genus Dasylirion, most commonly: Dasylirion wheeleri, Dasylirion durangense, Dasylirion cedrosanum, and Dasylirion leiophyllum, less commonly with Dasylirion texanum and Dasylirion lucidum (commonly known as Desert Spoon or, in Spanish, sotol, sereque, cucharilla, or palmilla), plants that grow in the Chihuahuan desert of northern Mexico, New Mexico, Arizona, and west and central Texas.",,1
23,Sugarcane,"A species of (often hybrid) tall, perennial grass (in the genus Saccharum, tribe Andropogoneae) that is used for sugar production. The plants are 2–6 m (6–20 ft) tall with stout, jointed, fibrous stalks that are rich in sucrose, which accumulates in the stalk internodes. Grown in tropical and subtropical regions, sugarcane is the world's largest crop by production quantity, totaling 1.9 billion tonnes in 2020, with Brazil accounting for 40% of the world total.",,1
24,Rum,"Made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses or sugarcane juice. The distillate, a clear liquid, is often aged in barrels of oak. While strongly associated with the Caribbean to this day due to its Barbadian origin, rum is nowadays produced in nearly every major sugar-producing region of the world, such as the Philippines, where Tanduay Distillers, the largest producer of rum worldwide, has its headquarters.",,1
25,Rhum Agricole,"Is the French term for sugarcane juice rum, a style of rum originally distilled in the French Caribbean islands from freshly squeezed sugarcane juice rather than molasses. Rhum is the term that typically distinguishes it in French-speaking locales from the rum made with molasses in other parts of the West Indies (Rum, Ron).",,1
26,Clairin,"Made from sugarcane produced in Haiti, that undergoes the same distillation process as rhum.",,1
27,Spiced Rum,"Obtains its flavors through the addition of spices and, sometimes, caramel. Most are darker in colour, and based on gold rums. Some are significantly darker, while many cheaper brands are made from inexpensive white rums and darkened with caramel colour. Among the spices added are cinnamon, rosemary, absinthe/aniseed, pepper, cloves, and cardamom.",,1
28,Dark Rum,"Know by their particular colour, such as brown, black, or red rums, they are classes a grade darker than gold rums. They are usually made from caramelized sugar or molasses. They are generally aged longer, in heavily charred barrels, giving them much stronger flavors than either light or gold rums, and hints of spices can be detected, along with a strong molasses or caramel overtone. They commonly provide substance in rum drinks, as well as colour. In addition, dark rum is the type most commonly used in cooking. Most dark rums come from areas such as Jamaica, Bahamas, Haiti, and Martinique.",,1
29,Gold Rum,"Also called ""amber"" rums, are medium-bodied rums that are generally aged. These gain their dark colour from aging in wooden barrels (usually the charred, white oak barrels that are the byproduct of Bourbon whiskey). They have more flavor and are stronger tasting than light rum and can be considered midway between light rum and the darker varieties.",,1
30,Light Rum,"Also referred to as ""silver"" or ""white"" rums, in general, have very little flavor aside from a general sweetness. Light rums are sometimes filtered after aging to remove any colour. The majority of light rums come from Puerto Rico. Their milder flavors make them popular for use in mixed drinks, as opposed to drinking them straight.",,1
31,Overproofed Rum,"Are much higher than the standard 40% ABV (80 proof), with many as high as 75% (150 proof) to 80% (160 proof) available. ",,1
32,Cachaca,"Made from fermented sugarcane juice. Also known as pinga, caninha, and other names, it is the most popular spirit among distilled alcoholic beverages in Brazil.",,1
33,White Cachaca,Usually bottled immediately after distillation and tends to be cheaper. Some producers age it for up to 12 months in wooden barrels to achieve a smoother blend. It is often used as an ingredient in caipirinha and other mixed beverages.,,1
34,Dark Cachaca,"Usually seen as the ""premium"" variety, is aged in wood barrels and is meant to be drunk neat. It is usually aged for up to 3 years, though some ultra-premium cachaças have been aged for up to 15 years. Its flavour is influenced by the type of wood the barrel is made from.",,1
35,Pisco,Is a colorless or yellowish-to-amber colored spirit produced in winemaking regions of Peru and Chile. Made by distilling fermented grape juice into a high-proof spirit.,,1
36,Peruvian Pisco,"Must be made in the country's five official D.O. (Denomination of Origin) departments—Lima, Ica, Arequipa, Moquegua and Tacna (only in the valleys of Locumba Locumba, Sama and Caplina)— established in 1991 by the government. In Peru, pisco is produced only using copper pot stills, like single malt Scotch whiskies, rather than continuous stills like most vodkas. Unlike the Chilean variety, Peruvian pisco is never diluted after it is distilled and enters the bottle directly at its distillation strength. The production of a regular Peruvian Pisco bottle requires 8 kilograms of grapes, and a Mosto Verde variety needs 12 kg. Must be aged for a minimum of three months in vessels of ""glass, stainless steel or any other material which does not alter its physical, chemical or organic properties"".",,1
37,Puro Pisco,"A classification of Peruvian Pisco, made from a single variety of grape, mostly Quebranta, although Mollar or Common Black can be used; however, no blending between varieties is accepted (""pure"" pisco should contain only one variety of grape).",,1
38,Aromaticas Pisco,"A classification of Peruvian Pisco,  made from Muscat or Muscat-derived grape varieties, and also from Albilla, Italia and Torontel grape varieties; once again, the pisco should only contain one variety of grape in any production lot.",,1
39,Mosto Verde (Green Must) Pisco,"A classification of Peruvian Pisco. Distilled from partially fermented must, this must be distilled before the fermentation process has completely transformed sugars into alcohol",,1
40,Alcolado Pisco,A classification of Peruvian Pisco. Blended from the must of several varieties of grape.,,1
41,Chilean Pisco,"Chilean pisco must be made in the country's two official D.O. (Denomination of Origin) regions—Atacama and Coquimbo—established in 1931 by the government. Most of it is produced with a ""boutique"" type of distillate. Other types are produced with double distillation in copper and other materials. During the adaptation of many vineyards to pisco production, the most widespread grape was used as raw material, the Muscat, with some vineyards preferring the Torontel and Pedro Jiménez varieties.",,1
42,Pisco Corriente o Tradicional,A classification of Chilean Pisco. 30% to 35% (60 to 70 proof),,1
43,Pisco Especial,A classification of Chilean Pisco. 35% to 40% (70 to 80 proof),,1
44,Pisco Reservado,A classification of Chilean Pisco. 40% (80 proof),,1
45,Gran Pisco,A classification of Chilean Pisco. 43% or more (86 or more proof),,1
46,Vodka,"Clear distilled alcoholic beverage. Different varieties originated in Poland, Russia, and Sweden. Vodka is composed mainly of water and ethanol but sometimes with traces of impurities and flavourings. Traditionally, it is made by distilling liquid from fermented cereal grains, and potatoes since introduced in Europe in the 1700s. Some modern brands use corn, sugar cane, fruits, honey, and maple sap as the base. Since the 1890s, standard vodkas have been 40% alcohol by volume (ABV) (80 U.S. proof). The European Union has established a minimum alcohol content of 37.5% for vodka. Vodka in the United States must have a minimum alcohol content of 40%.",,1
47,Gin,A distilled alcoholic drink flavoured with juniper berries and other botanical ingredients. ,,1
48,Sloe Gin,"A British red liqueur made with gin and blackthorn fruits (sloes), which are the drupe fruit of the Prunus spinosa tree, which is a relative of the plum.[1] As an alcoholic drink, sloe gin contains between 15 per cent and 30 per cent alcohol by volume (ABV); however, European Union regulations established 25 per cent ABV as the minimal alcoholic content for the blackthorn beverage to be a sloe gin. Historically, despite being a liqueur based upon gin, the EU included the colloquial name sloe gin to the legal definitions; thus, sloe gin is the only alcoholic beverage that legally uses the term gin without appending the liqueur suffix.",,1
49,Plymouth Gin,"A style and brand of gin that has been distilled on the same premises on the Barbican in Plymouth, Devon, since 1793. The site of production, the Plymouth Gin Distillery, was built in 1431 and is reputed to have once been a monastery of the Dominican Order, widely known as ""Black Friars"". For this reason, it has traditionally been called the ""Black Friars Distillery"", and this name appears embossed on the gin bottles. The taste profile of the style has been described as ""earthy"", and featuring more citrus notes[3] than the ""London Dry"" gin style, of which Plymouth Gin is considered an offshoot, or subtype.",,1
50,Old Tom Gin,"Prior to the invention of London Dry Gin, Old tom was gin that was sweetened with liquorice and flavored with botanicals to mask poor distillation. Nowadays refers to a style of sweetened gin containing 2-6% sugars by volume otherwise known as a ""cordial"" style of gin.",,1
51,London Dry Gin,"Emerged as a dry refined style of gin, originally only made in London, soon after the 'Coffey' continuous still was invented in 1831, enabling production of highly rectified (nearly pure) spirit. The high distillation strength removed the unpleasant flavors found in earlier gins so the new spirits could be sold unsweetened or ""dry"".",,1
52,Genever Gin,"also known as Hollands, genever, genièvre, peket, or sometimes as Dutch gin (archaic: Holland gin or Geneva gin), is the juniper-flavoured traditional liquor in the Netherlands, Belgium and adjoining areas in northern France and northwestern Germany. As an EU and UK Protected Designation of Origin the use of the term jenever and its soundalikes can only be used if the product is made according to the specifications in Belgium, the Netherlands, two northern French departments and two German federal states. Gin was developed in Britain after introduction of jenever to the island.",,1
53,New Western Dry / New American Gin,"Gin distilled with the legal amount of juniper, but with other flavourful botanicals that ease the profile of the juniper and incorporate more varied taste profiles depending on the botanicals included. Term was coined by Aviation Gin co-founder Ryan Margarin, but has been a style experimented with by other gin distillers prior to Aviations founding.",,1
54,Amaro,"An Italian herbal liqueur that is commonly consumed as an after-dinner digestif. It usually has a bitter-sweet flavour, sometimes syrupy, and has an alcohol content between 16% and 40%. Similar liqueurs have traditionally been produced throughout Europe. There are local varieties in Germany (where they are called Kräuterlikör), Hungary, the Netherlands, and France. But the term amaro is applied only to Italian products of this kind. Amaro is typically produced by macerating herbs, roots, flowers, bark, and/or citrus peels in alcohol, either neutral spirits or wine, mixing the filtrate with sugar syrup, and allowing the mixture to age in casks or bottles.",,1
55,Bitters,"Traditionally an alcoholic preparation flavored with botanical matter for a bitter or bittersweet flavor. Originally, numerous longstanding brands of bitters were developed as patent medicines, but now are sold as digestifs, sometimes with herbal properties, and as cocktail flavorings. Since cocktails often contain sour and sweet flavors, bitters are used to engage another primary taste and thereby balance out the drink and make it more complex, giving it a more complete flavor profile.",,1
56,Liqueur,"An alcoholic drink composed of spirits (often rectified spirit) and additional flavorings such as sugar, fruits, herbs, and spices. Often served with or after dessert, they are typically heavily sweetened and un-aged beyond a resting period during production, when necessary, for their flavors to mingle. Liqueurs are historical descendants of herbal medicines. They were made in France as early as the 13th century, often prepared by monks (for example, Chartreuse). Today they are produced all over the world, commonly served neat, over ice, with coffee, in cocktails, and used in cooking.",,1
57,Cordial,Another word used for liqueur,,1
58,Digestif,"An alcoholic beverage served after a meal, traditionally believed to aid digestion[8] even though there is not strong evidence to support this.[9] When served after a coffee course, it may be called pousse-café. Digestifs are usually taken neat.",,1
59,Aperitif,"An alcoholic beverage usually served before a meal to stimulate the appetite, and is usually dry rather than sweet. Common choices for an apéritif are vermouth; champagne; pastis; gin; ouzo; fino; amontillado or other styles of dry sherry (but not usually cream or oloroso blended sherry, which is very sweet and rich).",,1
60,Brandy,"A liquor produced by distilling wine. Brandy generally contains 35–60% alcohol by volume (70–120 US proof) and is typically consumed as an after-dinner digestif. Some brandies are aged in wooden casks. Others are coloured with caramel colouring to imitate the effect of ageing, and some are produced using a combination of ageing and colouring. Varieties of wine brandy can be found across the winemaking world. Among the most renowned are Cognac and Armagnac from south-western France.

In a broader sense, the term brandy also denotes liquors obtained from the distillation of pomace (yielding pomace brandy), or mash or wine of any other fruit (fruit brandy).[3][1] These products are also called eau de vie (literally ""water of life"" in French).",,1
61,Pomace Brandy,"A liquor distilled from pomace that is left over from winemaking, after the grapes are pressed. It is called marc in both English and French, but ""grappa"" in Italian and ""bagaço"" in Portuguese. In Spanish it is called orujo. Alcohol derived from pomace is also used as the traditional base spirit of other liquors, such as some anise-flavored spirits. Unlike wine brandy, most pomace brandies are neither aged nor coloured.",,1
62,Grappa,"An alcoholic beverage: a fragrant, grape-based pomace brandy of Italian origin that contains 35 to 60 percent alcohol by volume (70 to 120 US proof). Grappa is a protected name in the European Union. Grappa is made by distilling the skins, pulp, seeds and stems (i.e., the pomace) left over from winemaking after pressing the grapes. It was originally made to prevent waste by using these leftovers. A similar drink, known as acquavite d'uva, is made by distilling whole must.",,1
63,Orujo,"A pomace brandy (a liquor obtained from the distillation of marc, the solid remains left after pressing of the grape) from northern Spain. It is a transparent spirit with an alcohol content over 50% (100° proof). Its name comes from the expression ""aguardiente de orujo"" (pomace spirit). It is popular in northern Spain, particularly in Galicia, but also in Asturias, Castile and León and Cantabria (principally in the valley of Liébana). It is also called augardente or aguardiente (""firewater""), and caña. Orujo has become an artisanal craft for some families who after making wine for themselves distill the pomace in a little pot still. Many high-quality distilled spirits have appeared in the last twenty years, including some origin appellations (in Spanish D.O.). These are obtained from quality grapes and produced according to the highest standards and are replacing the traditional homemade liquor, nowadays only available in small villages.",,1
64,Eau de Vie," Meaning 'Water of Life', eau de vie is a clear, colourless fruit brandy that is produced by means of fermentation and double distillation. The fruit flavor is typically very light.",,1
65,Schnapps,"A type of alcoholic beverage that may take several forms, including distilled fruit brandies, Herbal liqueurs, infusions, and ""flavored liqueurs"" made by adding fruit syrups, spices, or artificial flavorings to neutral grain spirits.",,1
66,German Schnaps,"Refers to ""any kind of strong, dry spirit"", similar to how eau de vie (water of life) is used in French, aguardiente (burning water) in Spanish, or aguardente Portuguese.",,1
67,American Schnapps,"An inexpensive, heavily sweetened form of liqueur is made in America by mixing neutral grain spirit with fruit syrup, spices, or other flavors. Referred to as ""schnapps"",[6] these are bottled with an alcohol content typically between 15 and 20% ABV (30–40 proof), though some may be much higher. Schnapps, specifically peach and peppermint schnapps, exploded in popularity in America in the 1980s.",,1
68,Cognac,"A variety of brandy named after the commune of Cognac, France. It is produced in the surrounding wine-growing region in the departments of Charente and Charente-Maritime. Cognac production falls under French appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) designation, with production methods and naming required to meet certain legal requirements. Among the specified grapes, Ugni blanc, known locally as Saint-Émilion, is most widely used.[5] The brandy must be twice distilled in copper pot stills and aged at least two years in French oak barrels from Limousin or Tronçais. Cognac matures in the same way as whiskies and wines barrel-age, and most cognacs spend considerably longer ""on the wood"" than the minimum legal requirement.",,1
69,Armagnac,"A distinctive kind of brandy produced in the Armagnac region in Gascony, southwest France. It is distilled from wine usually made from a blend of grapes including Baco 22A, Colombard, Folle blanche and Ugni blanc, traditionally using column stills rather than the pot stills used in the production of cognac, which is made predominantly from ugni blanc grapes. The resulting spirit is then aged in oak barrels before release. Production is overseen by the Institut national de l'origine et de la qualité (INAO) and the Bureau National Interprofessionel de l'Armagnac (BNIA).",,1
70,Vermouth,"An aromatized fortified wine, flavoured with various botanicals (roots, barks, flowers, seeds, herbs, and spices) and sometimes colored. The modern versions of the beverage were first produced in the mid to late 18th century in Turin, Italy. While vermouth was traditionally used for medicinal purposes, it was later served as an apéritif, with fashionable cafés in Turin serving it to guests around the clock. In the late 19th century, it became popular with bartenders as a key ingredient for cocktails, such as the martini, the Manhattan, the Rob Roy, and the Negroni. In addition to being consumed as an aperitif or cocktail ingredient, vermouth is sometimes used as an alternative to white wine in cooking.",,1
71,Fortified Wine,"A wine to which a distilled spirit, usually brandy, has been added. In the course of some centuries, winemakers have developed many different styles of fortified wine, including port, sherry, madeira, Marsala, Commandaria wine, and the aromatised wine vermouth.",,1
72,Dry Vermouth,,,1
73,Sweet Vermouth,,,1
74,Blanc Vermouth,,,1
75,Sherry,"A fortified wine made from white grapes that are grown near the city of Jerez de la Frontera in Andalusia, Spain. Sherry is a drink produced in a variety of styles made primarily from the Palomino grape, ranging from light versions similar to white table wines, such as Manzanilla and fino, to darker and heavier versions that have been allowed to oxidise as they age in barrel, such as Amontillado and oloroso. Sweet dessert wines are also made from Pedro Ximénez or Moscatel grapes, and are sometimes blended with Palomino-based sherries.",,1
76,Solera,"A process for aging liquids such as wine, beer, vinegar, and brandy, by fractional blending in such a way that the finished product is a mixture of ages, with the average age gradually increasing as the process continues over many years. The purpose of this labor-intensive process is the maintenance of a reliable style and quality of the beverage over time.Solera means ""on the ground"" in Spanish, and it refers to the lower level of the set of barrels or other containers used in the process; the liquid is traditionally transferred from barrel to barrel, top to bottom, the oldest mixtures being in the barrel right ""on the ground"". The containers in today's process are not necessarily stacked physically in this way but merely carefully labeled. Products which are often solera aged include Sherry, Madeira, Lillet, Port wine, Marsala, Mavrodafni, Muscat, and Muscadelle wines; Balsamic, Commandaria, some Vins doux naturels, and Sherry vinegars; Brandy de Jerez; beer; rums; and whiskies. Since the origin of this process is the Iberian peninsula, most of the traditional terminology is in Spanish and Portuguese.",,1
77,Wine,"An alcoholic drink made from fermented fruit. Yeast consumes the sugar in the fruits and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide, releasing heat in the process. Though wine can be made from a variety of fruit crops such as plum, cherry, pomegranate, blueberry, currant and elderberry, it is most often made from grapes, and the term ""wine"" generally refers to grape wine when used without a qualifier.",,1
78,Red Wine,"Red wine gains its color and flavor (notably, tannins) from the grape skin, by allowing the grapes to soak in the extracted juice. Red wine is made from dark-colored red grape varieties. The actual color of the wine can range from violet, typical of young wines, through red for mature wines, to brown for older red wines. The juice from most red grapes is actually greenish-white; the red color comes from anthocyanins present in the skin of the grape. A notable exception is the family of rare teinturier varieties, which actually have red flesh and produce red juice.",,1
79,White Wine,"To make white wine, grapes are pressed quickly with the juice immediately drained away from the grape skins. The grapes used are typically white grape varieties, though red grapes may be used if the winemaker is careful not to let the skin stain the wort during the separation of the pulp-juice. For example, pinot noir (a red grape) is commonly used in champagne. Dry (low sugar) white wine is the most common, derived from the complete fermentation of the juice, however sweet white wines such as Moscato d'Asti are also made.",,1
80,Orange Wine,"Sometimes called amber wines, these are wines made with white grapes but with the skins allowed to soak during pressing, similar to red and rosé wine production. They are notably tannic, and usually made dry.",,1
81,Rosé Wine,"Gains color from red grape skins, but not enough to qualify it as a red wine. It may be the oldest known type of wine, as it is the most straightforward to make with the skin contact method. The color can range from a pale orange to a vivid near-purple, depending on the varietals used and wine-making techniques. There are three primary ways to produce rosé wine: Skin contact (allowing dark grape skins to stain the wort), saignée (removing juice from the must early in fermentation and continuing fermentation of the juice separately), and blending of a red and white wine (uncommon and discouraged in most wine growing regions). Rosé wines have a wide range of sweetness levels from dry Provençal rosé to sweet White Zinfandels and blushes. Rosé wines are made from a wide variety of grapes all over the world.",,1
82,Sparkling Wine,"Effervescent wines, made in any of the styles (ie, orange, red, rosé, white). They must undergo secondary fermentation to create carbon dioxide, which creates the bubbles. Two common methods of accomplishing this are the traditional method, used for Cava, Champagne, and more expensive sparkling wines, and the Charmat method, used for Prosecco, Asti, and less expensive wines. A hybrid transfer method is also used, yielding intermediate results, and simple addition of carbon dioxide is used in the cheapest of wines. The bottles used for sparkling wine must be thick to withstand the pressure of the gas behind the cork, which can be up to 6 standard atmospheres (88 psi).",,1
83,Pét-Nat,"There are two general approaches employed by winemakers to produce pét-nat, the choice of which is often determined by location and weather conditions during harvest as well as the scale of production and resources on hand in the winery when it comes to bottling. The first is the ""interruption"" method, whereby the primary alcoholic fermentation is interrupted by the act of bottling. The wine goes into bottle, sealed under a crown cap, where the still viable yeast, nutrient and sugar allow the primary fermentation to continue and produce the carbon dioxide that forms the bubbles. Malolactic fermentation may also occur in bottle making a small contribution to the carbon dioxide levels. Unlike the traditional method there is no disgorging and dosage, however producers using the interruption method will often need to remove tartrate crystals and sediment to prevent the wine from gushing when opened as well as to reduce the amount of final sediment to an acceptable level. To accomplish this, the bottles are hand disgorged and topped up with the same wine. The interruption method is often favoured by producers in cooler regions where the fermentation is slower and easier to catch at a specific point and where they have the resources to hand bottle at a specific time and to hand disgorge. The second method is called ""entr'acte"" (intermission) whereby the primary fermentation is completed to dryness, allowing the wine to be naturally cold stabilised and settled, either in an underground cellar or temperature controlled tank. Sweet juice from a second pick of grapes, often from the same vineyard, is then added to the wine, which is then bottled with the fermentation from the second pick juice completing in bottle to produce the bubbles. The advantages of the entr'acte method is that the wine does not need to be disgorged, there is more control over final sediment and pressure levels leading to an avoidance of gushing. The entr'acte method is often favoured in warmer climates where faster ferments are more difficult to control, as well as where producers want to be more precise with final turbidity and pressure levels as well as minimising overall risk. Alternatively, using a method faithful to the origins of ancestral winemaking, the wine is cold-settled before the end of primary fermentation to mimic the natural changing seasons before being bottled and then allowed to warm up again, as it would in the Spring. This process, a traditional variation on the entr'acte practice, is called the ""Overwintering Method,"" and is how the earliest sparkling wines would have come about, although as an intentional method of production it runs the risk of a stuck ferment.",,1
84,Traditional Method,"A double fermentation process used in the Champagne region of France to produce Champagne. It is also the method used in various French regions to produce sparkling wines (not called ""Champagne""), in Spain to produce cava, in Portugal to produce Espumante and in Italy to produce Franciacorta. The method is known as the méthode champenoise, but the Champagne producers have successfully lobbied the European Union to restrict the use of that term within the EU only to wines produced in Champagne. Thus, wines from elsewhere cannot use the term ""méthode champenoise"" on products sold in the EU, and instead the term ""traditional method"" (méthode traditionnelle) or the local language equivalent (método tradicional in Spain and Portugal, metodo classico or metodo tradizionale in Italy, and in Germany klassische Flaschengärung). South African wines from the Western Cape are labelled with the term Methode Cap Classique. Some wine producers in countries outside the EU may disregard EU labeling laws and use méthode champenoise or even ""Champagne"" on labels for products not exported to the EU, but this usage is decreasing.",,1
85,Charmat Method,"Charmat (Italian: Metodo Martinotti) was developed and patented in 1895 by the Italian Federico Martinotti (1860–1924). The method was further developed with a new patent by the inventor Eugène Charmat in 1907. The method is now named after the latter, but is also called cuve close, metodo Italiano or the tank method. The wine is mixed in a stainless steel pressure tank, together with sugar and yeast. Fermentation occurs in a closed system, so CO2 cannot directly escape to the atmosphere and dissolves in wine. When the sugar is converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide, the yeast is filtered and removed, and the wine containing the dissolved CO2 is transferred from the close reactor vessel into bottles. The duration of fermentation affects the quality; longer fermentation preserves the wine's aromas better and gives finer and more durable bubbles.This production method is widely used in the U.S., in Italy, especially in the Asti province, and in Prosecco wines, and in Germany to produce variants of Sekt such as Henkell Trocken. Charmat-method sparkling wines can be produced at a considerably lower cost than traditional method wines.",,1
86,Champagne,"A sparkling wine originated and produced in the Champagne wine region of France under the rules of the appellation, which demand specific vineyard practices, sourcing of grapes exclusively from designated places within it, specific grape-pressing methods and secondary fermentation of the wine in the bottle to cause carbonation. The grapes Pinot noir, Pinot meunier, and Chardonnay are used to produce almost all Champagne, but small amounts of Pinot blanc, Pinot gris (called Fromenteau in Champagne), Arbane, and Petit Meslier are vinified as well.",,1
87,Cava,"a sparkling wine of denominación de origen (DO) status from Spain. It may be white (blanco) or rosé (rosado). The Macabeo, Parellada and Xarel·lo are the most popular and traditional grape varieties for producing cava.Chardonnay and Malvasia are also permitted. Authorized red grapes are Garnacha tinta, Monastrell, Trepat, and Pinot Noir. Only wines produced in the traditional method may be labelled ""cava""; those produced by other processes may only be called ""sparkling wines"" (vinos espumosos). About 95% of all cava is produced in the Penedès area in Catalonia, Spain, with the village of Sant Sadurní d'Anoia being home to many of the largest Catalan production houses.  The two major producers are Codorníu and Freixenet. Cava is also produced in other villages in the provinces of Girona, Lleida, Tarragona, and Barcelona in Catalonia, Zaragoza in Aragon, Badajoz in Extremadura, La Rioja, Araba/Álava in the Basque Country, Navarra and València in the Valencian Community.",,1
88,Prosecco,"An Italian DOC or DOCG white wine produced in a large area spanning nine provinces in the Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia regions, and named after the village of Prosecco, which is in the province of Trieste, Italy. It is made from the Prosecco grape (renamed ""Glera"" in Italy in 2009) but denomination rules allow up to 15% of the wine to be other permitted varieties. Prosecco is almost always made in sparkling or semi-sparkling style (spumante and frizzante, respectively), but a still wine (tranquillo) is also permitted. Within the larger designation are two small DOCG areas, Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco in the hills between the towns of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene, and Asolo Prosecco around the nearby town of Asolo. Prosecco Superiore is always spumante and comes only from these DOCG areas.",,1
89,Trento,"An appellation for white and rosé sparkling wine made in Trentino, Italy. Trentinos developed this appellation, the second in the world after Champagne, to ensure quality and distinction. Only Chardonnay, Pinot noir, and Pinot Meunier with Pinot blanc are permitted, and they must be grown in a well-defined area within the Province of TrentoA",,1
90,Espumante,"Espumante is the Portuguese version of a sparkling wine. Unlike Cava, which is produced solely in northern climates, Espumante is not only produced in the northern wet region of Vinho Verde, but also throughout Portugal all the way to the southern region of the Alentejo, known for its extreme temperatures and arid climate. While Spain has one regulating body, DOC Cava, spread across several different political regions, quality Espumante is produced solely in DOC Bairrada, located just south of Vinho Verde. In order for a wine to be certified as a quality Espumante from DOC Bairrada, it must be made in the traditional champagne (indicating the year of harvest) and stamped with the VEQPRD (Vinho Espumante de Qualidade Produzido em Região Determinada) certification.",,1
91,Dessert Wine,"Sweet wines that have a high level of sugar remaining after fermentation. There are various ways of increasing the amount of sugar in a wine, yielding products with different strengths and names. Icewine, Port, Sauternes, Tokaji Aszú, Trockenbeerenauslese, and Vin Santo are some examples.",,1
92,Ice wine,"A type of dessert wine produced from grapes that have been frozen while still on the vine. The sugars and other dissolved solids do not freeze, but the water does, allowing for a more concentrated grape juice to develop. The grapes' must is then pressed from the frozen grapes, resulting in a smaller amount of more concentrated, very sweet juice. With icewines, the freezing happens before the fermentation, not afterwards.",,1
93,Port Wine,"A Portuguese fortified wine produced in the Douro Valley of northern Portugal. It is typically a sweet red wine, often served with dessert, although it also comes in dry, semi-dry, and white varieties. Other port-style fortified wines are produced outside Portugal – in Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, India, South Africa, Spain, and the United States – but under the European Union Protected Designation of Origin guidelines, only wines from Portugal are allowed to be labelled ""port"".",,1
94,Sauternes,"A French sweet wine from the region of the same name in the Graves section in Bordeaux. Sauternes wine is made from Sémillon, sauvignon blanc, and muscadelle grapes that have been affected by Botrytis cinerea, also known as noble rot. This causes the grapes to become partially raisined, resulting in concentrated and distinctively flavored wines. Due to its climate, Sauternes is one of the few wine regions where infection with noble rot is a frequent occurrence. Even so, production is a hit-or-miss proposition, with widely varying harvests from vintage to vintage.",,1
95,Vin Santo,"A style of Italian dessert wine. Traditional in Tuscany, these wines are often made from white grape varieties such as Trebbiano and Malvasia, though Sangiovese may be used to produce a rosé style known as ""Occhio di Pernice"" or eye of the partridge. The wines may also be described as straw wines since they are often produced by drying the freshly harvested grapes on straw mats in a warm and well ventilated area of the house (however, several producers dry the grapes by hanging on racks indoors). Though technically a dessert wine, a Vin Santo can vary in sweetness levels from bone dry (like a Fino Sherry) to extremely sweet. While the style is believed to have originated in Tuscany, examples of Vin Santo can be found throughout Italy and it is an authorised style of wine for several denominazione di origine controllata (DOCs) and indicazione geografica tipica (IGTs).",,1
96,Trockenbeerenauslese,"A German botrytized wine made entirely from the individually selected grapes fully ""dried"" from Botrytis cinerea (""noble rot""), hence the name. Trockenbeerenauslese is a very sweet wine, highest among the wines of the QmP (""quality wine with distinction"") category that includes also Auslese and Beerenauslese.",,1
97,Tokaji Aszú,"AKA Tokay is the name of the wines from the Tokaj wine region (also Tokaj-Hegyalja wine region or Tokaj-Hegyalja) in Hungary or the adjoining Tokaj wine region in Slovakia. This region is noted for its sweet wines made from grapes affected by noble rot, a style of wine which has a long history in this region. The ""nectar"" coming from the grapes of Tokaj is also mentioned in the national anthem of Hungary.",,1
98,Botrytized Wine,"Wine produced from grapes affected by Noble Rot.Noble Rot is the beneficial form of a grey fungus, Botrytis cinerea, affecting wine grapes. Infestation by Botrytis requires moist conditions, but if the weather stays wet, the damaging form, ""grey rot"", can destroy crops of grapes. Grapes typically become infected with Botrytis when they are ripe. If they are then exposed to drier conditions and become partially raisined, this form of infection is known as noble rot. Grapes picked at a certain point during infestation can produce particularly fine and concentrated sweet wine.",,1
99,Madeira,"A fortified wine, produced in the Madeira Islands; varieties may be sweet or dry. It has a history dating back to the Age of Exploration when Madeira was a standard port of call for ships heading to the New World or East Indies. To prevent the wine from spoiling, neutral grape spirits were added. However, wine producers of Madeira discovered, when an unsold shipment of wine returned to the islands after a round trip, that the flavour of the wine had been transformed by exposure to heat and movement. Today, Madeira is noted for its unique winemaking process that involves heating the wine and deliberately exposing the wine to some levels of oxidation. Most countries limit the use of the term Madeira to those wines that come from the Madeira Islands, to which the European Union grants Protected designation of origin (PDO) status.",,1
100,Pastis,"An anise-flavoured spirit and apéritif traditionally from France, typically containing less than 100 g/L sugar and 40–45% ABV",,1
101,Absinthe,"An anise-flavored spirit derived from several plants, including the flowers and leaves of Artemisia absinthium (""grand wormwood""), together with green anise, sweet fennel, and other medicinal and culinary herbs. Historically described as a highly alcoholic spirit, it is 45–74% ABV or 90–148 proof in the US. Absinthe traditionally has a natural green color but may also be colorless. It is commonly referred to in historical literature as la fée verte (""the green fairy""). It is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a liqueur, but is not traditionally bottled with added sugar, so is classified as a spirit. Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but it is normally diluted with water before being consumed.",,1
102,Ouzo,"A dry anise-flavored aperitif that is widely consumed in Greece. It is made from rectified spirits that have undergone a process of distillation and flavoring. Its taste is similar to other anise liquors like pastis, sambuca, rakı and arak.",,1
103,Sambuca,"An Italian anise-flavoured liqueur. Its most common variety is often referred to as white sambuca to differentiate it from other varieties that are deep blue (black sambuca) or bright red (red sambuca). Like other anise-flavoured liqueurs, the ouzo effect is sometimes observed when combined with water.",,1
104,Beer,"An alcoholic drink produced by the brewing and fermentation of starches from cereal grains—most commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), rice, and oats are also used. The fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation. Most beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and act as a preservative and stabilising agent. Other flavouring agents, such as gruit, herbs, or fruits, may also be used. In commercial brewing, natural carbonation is often replaced with forced carbonation.",,1

109,Ale,"A type of beer originating in medieval England, brewed using a warm fermentation method.[1][2] Historically, the term referred to a drink brewed without hops. As with most beers, ale typically has a bittering agent to balance the malt and act as a preservative. Ale was originally bittered with gruit, a mixture of herbs or spices boiled in the wort before fermentation. Later, hops replaced gruit as the bittering agent.",,1
110,India Pale Ale (IPA),"Stands for ""India Pale Ale"" and got its name from British sailors on six-month voyages at sea. The weather in England is drastically different from the climate in India, so the sailors wanted a beer that could handle the changing temperatures and still taste good. Those English sailors needed a beer that would stay good during the long journey from their home to India. That’s not all, though — they had to find a recipe capable of withstanding the hot, humid temperatures. The actual brewing process was difficult, or even impossible, to pull off in India’s climate, so brewing there wasn’t much of an option. The sailors found the secret weapon they were looking for in the form of hops. Hops are why IPAs are so widely known — it’s their distinctly hoppy aromas and flavors. As time went on, IPAs became more of an art form than a necessity, so different hop varieties have been created over the years to augment flavor rather than for preservation purposes.",,1
111,India Pale Lager (IPL),"The India Pale Lager is a hybrid of the American IPA with many examples giving a nod to IPAs on the west coast. Typically golden in color with some hop haze in some examples. Malt profiles are often clean and bready, allowing the focus to be on the hop varieties featured by the brewer. Bitterness levels vary, but range from moderate to high.",,1
112,Craft Beer,"A beer that has been made by craft breweries, which typically produce smaller amounts of beer, than larger ""macro"" breweries, and are often independently owned. Such breweries are generally perceived and marketed as emphasising enthusiasm, new flavours, and varied brewing techniques.",,1
113,Black India Pale Ale (BIPA),"It’s a typical IPA recipe, but utilising some darker malts. These malts not only bring the colour to the beer, but also more roasted/toasty/caramel and even chocolate or coffee notes to the beer. This, combined with a heavy dosing of hops, is what creates these unique beers. There is of course, yeast and water profiles to manage",,1
114,White India Pale Ale (WIPA),"A white IPA has a wide colour range, from light yellow to deep gold. This brew is hazy from the use of wheat in the grain bill. A large white head that lingers is a prominent feature of this beer. This brew has a moderate bitterness, with an IBU range of 40 - 70, and an ABV that is higher than the usual witbier but within the range of a typical IPA (5.5 - 7%.).",,1
115,New England India Pale Ale (NEIPA),"The New England India Pale Ale is an American IPA with intense fruit flavors and aromas, a soft body, and smooth mouthfeel, and often opaque with substantial haze. Less perceived bitterness than traditional IPAs but always massively hop forward. This emphasis on late hopping, especially dry hopping, with hops with tropical fruit qualities lends the specific ‘juicy’ character for which this style is known.",,1
116,Lager,"A type of beer brewed and conditioned at low temperature. Lagers can be pale, amber, or dark. Pale lager is the most widely consumed and commercially available style of beer.[2] The term ""lager"" comes from the German word for ""storage"", as the beer was stored before drinking, traditionally in the same cool caves in which it was fermented. As well as maturation in cold storage, most lagers are distinguished by the use of Saccharomyces pastorianus, a ""bottom-fermenting"" yeast that ferments at relatively cold temperatures.",,1
117,Pale Lager,"A pale-to-golden lager beer with a well-attenuated body and a varying degree of noble hop bitterness. In the mid-19th century, Gabriel Sedlmayr took British pale ale brewing and malt making techniques back to the Spaten Brewery in Germany and applied them to existing lagering methods. The resulting beers gradually spread around the globe to become the most common form of beer consumed in the world today.",,1
118,Pilsner,"A type of pale lager. It takes its name from the Bohemian city of Plzeň (German: Pilsen), where the world's first pale lager (now known as Pilsner Urquell) was produced in 1842 by Pilsner Urquell Brewery.",,1
119,Irish Red Ale,"Also known as red ale or Irish ale, is a style of pale ale that is brewed using a moderate amount of kilned malts and roasted barley, giving the beer its red colour. Its strength typically ranges from 3.8% to 4.8% alcohol by volume, although some craft varieties can be as high as 6%. In the United States, ""Irish red"" is sometimes used to describe a darker amber ale or a ""red"" beer that is a lager with caramel colouring. However, these beers are not Irish red ales.",,1
120,Flanders Red Ale,"AKA Flemish red-brown, is a style of sour ale brewed in West Flanders, Belgium. Flanders red ale is fermented with organisms other than Saccharomyces cerevisiae, especially Lactobacillus, which produces a sour character attributable to lactic acid. Long periods of aging are employed, a year or more, often in oak barrels, to impart a lactic acid character to the beer. Red malt is used to give the beer its colour and the matured beer is often blended with a younger batch before bottling to balance and round the character. Flanders red ales have a strong fruit flavour similar to the aroma, but more intense. Plum, prune, raisin and raspberry are the most common flavours, followed by orange and some spiciness. The sour or acidic taste can range from moderate to strong. There is no hop bitterness, but tannins are common. Consequently, Flanders red ales are often described as the most wine-like of all beers.",,1
121,Brown Ale,"A style of beer with a dark amber or brown colour. The term was first used by London brewers in the late 17th century to describe a lightly hopped ale brewed from 100% brown malt. Today brown ales are made in England, Belgium and America. Beers termed brown ale include sweet, low alcohol beers such as Manns Original Brown Ale, medium strength amber beers of moderate bitterness such as Newcastle Brown Ale, and malty but hoppy beers such as Sierra Nevada Brown Ale.",,1
122,Blonde Ale,"Blonde AKA Golden ales are very pale in colour. The term ""blonde"" for pale beers is common in Europe and South America – particularly in France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, the UK, and Brazil – though the beers may not have much in common, other than colour. Blondes tend to be clear, crisp, and dry, with low-to-medium bitterness and aroma from hops, and some sweetness from malt. Fruitiness from esters may be perceived. A lighter body from higher carbonation may be noticed. In the United Kingdom, golden or summer ales were developed in the late 20th century by breweries to compete with the pale lager market. A typical golden ale has an appearance and profile similar to that of a pale lager. Malt character is subdued and the hop profile ranges from spicy to citrus; common hops include Styrian Golding and Cascade. Alcohol is in the 4% to 5% abv range. The UK style is attributed to John Gilbert, owner of Hop Back Brewery, who developed ""Summer Lightning"" in 1989, which won several awards and inspired numerous imitators.Belgian blondes are often made with pilsner malt. Some beer writers regard blonde and golden ales as distinct styles, while others do not. Duvel is a typical Belgian blonde ale, and one of the most popular bottled beers in the country[28] as well as being well known internationally.",,1
123,Amber Ale,"Amber ale is an emerging term used in Australia, France (as ambrée), Belgium and the Netherlands and North America for pale ales brewed with a proportion of amber malt and sometimes crystal malt to produce an amber colour generally ranging from light copper to light brown. A small amount of crystal or other coloured malt is added to the basic pale ale base to produce a slightly darker colour, as in some Irish and British pale ales.",,1
124,American Pale Ale (APA),"a style of pale ale developed in the United States around 1980. American pale ales are generally around 5% abv with significant quantities of American hops, typically Cascade.[2] Although American brewed beers tend to use a cleaner yeast, and American two row malt, it is particularly the American hops that distinguish an APA from British or European pale ales. The style is close to the American India Pale Ale (IPA), and boundaries blur, though IPAs are stronger and more assertively hopped. The style is also close to amber ale, though ambers are darker and maltier due to use of crystal malts.",,1
125,English Pale Ale (EPA),"AKA ""Bitter"". The term ""bitter"" has been used in England to describe pale ale since the early 19th century. Although brewers used the term ""pale ale"", before the introduction of pump clips, customers in public houses would ask for ""bitter"" to differentiate it from mild ale; by the end of the 19th century, brewers had begun to use the term as well. During the 20th century, bitter became the most popular type of draught beer sold in British pubs and has been described as ""the national drink of England"". In Scotland, bitter is known as either ""light"" or ""heavy"" depending on the strength, colour and body. Bitter is traditionally cask conditioned and either dispensed by gravity through a tap in the cask or by a beer engine at ""cellar temperature"" of 11 to 14°C (50 to 55°F). The popularity of craft brewing in North America has led to British-style bitter being brewed there since the 1980s.",,1
126,Dry Hopped,"When hops are added late in the brewing process, most often in fermentation tanks, to ramp up specific aromas and flavors without extracting more the bittering qualities of hops.",,1
127,Double / Imperial IPA (DIPA),"A double IPA is an IPA that features extra hops and malt. The added layering of hops promotes more bitterness, while the extra malt provides a more distinct toasted or caramel malt flavor. When more malt is added, the yeast has more sugar to convert to alcohol, so you end up with a stronger brew.",,1
128,Stout,"A dark, top-fermented beer style which includes dry stout, oatmeal stout, milk stout and imperial stout. The first known use of the word ""stout"" for beer is in a document dated 1677 in the Egerton Manuscripts, referring to its strength. Porters were brewed to a variety of strengths, with the stronger beers, typically 7% or 8% alcohol by volume (ABV), called ""stout porters"". The history and development of stout and porter are thus intertwined.",,1
129,Dry Stout,"Mainly in Ireland that this non-sweet or standard stout was being made. As standard stout has a drier taste than the English and American sweet stouts, they came to be called dry stout or Irish stout to differentiate them from stouts with added lactose or oatmeal. This is the style that represents a typical stout to most people. The best selling stouts worldwide are Irish stouts made by Guinness (now owned by Diageo) at St. James's Gate Brewery (also known as the Guinness Brewery) in Dublin.",,1
130,Oatmeal Stout,"Oatmeal stout is a stout with a proportion of oats, normally a maximum of 30%, added during the brewing process. Even though a larger proportion of oats in beer can lead to a bitter or astringent taste, during the medieval period in Europe, oats were a common ingredient in ale, and proportions up to 35% were standard. Despite some areas of Europe, such as Norway, still clinging to the use of oats in brewing until the early part of the 20th century, the practice had largely died out by the 16th century, so much so that in 1513 Tudor sailors refused to drink oat beer offered to them because of the bitter flavour. Many breweries were still brewing oatmeal stouts in the 1950s, for example Brickwoods in Portsmouth, Matthew Brown in Blackburn and Ushers in Trowbridge. When Michael Jackson mentioned the defunct Eldrige Pope ""Oat Malt Stout"" in his 1977 book The World Guide to Beer, oatmeal stout was no longer being made anywhere, but Charles Finkel, founder of Merchant du Vin, was curious enough to commission Samuel Smith to produce a version. Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout then became the template for other breweries' versions. Oatmeal stouts do not usually taste specifically of oats. The smoothness of oatmeal stouts comes from the high content of proteins, lipids (includes fats and waxes), and gums imparted by the use of oats. The gums increase the viscosity and body adding to the sense of smoothness.",,1
131,Milk Stout,"Milk stout (also called sweet stout or cream stout) is a stout containing lactose, a sugar derived from milk. Because lactose cannot be fermented by beer yeast, it adds sweetness and perceived body to the finished beer. Milk stout, which was claimed to be nutritious, was given to nursing mothers, and to help increase their milk production. The classic surviving example of milk stout is Mackeson's, for which the original brewers advertised that ""each pint contains the energising carbohydrates of 10 ounces [284 ml] of pure dairy milk"". The style was rare until being revived by a number of craft breweries in the twenty-first century.",,1
132,Chocolate Stout,"Chocolate stout is a name brewers sometimes give to certain stouts having a noticeable dark chocolate flavour through the use of darker, more aromatic malt; particularly chocolate malt—a malt that has been roasted or kilned until it acquires a chocolate colour. Sometimes, as with Muskoka Brewery's Double Chocolate Cranberry Stout, Young's Double Chocolate Stout, and Rogue Brewery's Chocolate Stout, the beers are also brewed with a small amount of chocolate, chocolate flavouring, or cacao nibs.",,1
133,Imperial Stout,"Imperial stout, also known as ""Russian Imperial stout"", is a strong dark beer in the style that was brewed in the 18th century by Thrale's Anchor Brewery in London for export to the court of Catherine II of Russia. Imperial stouts have a high alcohol content, usually over 9% abv, and are among the darkest available beer styles. Samuel Smith's brewed a version for export to the United States in the early 1980s, and today Imperial stout is among the most popular beer styles with U.S. craft brewers. American interpretations of the style often include ingredients such as vanilla beans, chili powder, maple syrup, coffee, and marshmallows. Many are aged in bourbon barrels to add additional layers of flavour. The word ""Imperial"" is now commonly added to other beer styles to denote a stronger version, hence Imperial IPAs, Imperial pilsners etc.",,1
134,Porter,"A style of beer that was developed in London, England in the early 18th century. It is well-hopped and dark in appearance owing to the use of brown malt. The name is believed to have originated from its popularity with porters. The history of stout and porter are intertwined. The name ""stout"", used for a dark beer, came about because strong porters were marketed as ""stout porter"", later being shortened to just stout.",,1
135,Witbier,"A barley/wheat, top-fermented beer brewed mainly in Belgium and the Netherlands. It gets its name due to suspended yeast and wheat proteins, which cause the beer to look hazy, or white, when cold. Today, along with hops it usually contains a blend of spices, such as coriander, orange, and bitter orange.",,1
136,Weizebier,"Literally ""white beer"", referring to the pale air-dried malt, as opposed to ""brown beer"" made from dark malt dried over a hot kiln, Weizenbier is a beer, traditionally from Bavaria, in which a significant proportion of malted barley is replaced with malted wheat. Uses at least 52% wheat to barley malt to make a light-coloured top-fermenting beer.",,1
137,Wheat Beer,"A top-fermented beer which is brewed with a large proportion of wheat relative to the amount of malted barley. The two main varieties are German Weizenbier and Belgian witbier; other types include Lambic (made with wild yeast), Berliner Weisse (a cloudy, sour beer), and Gose (a sour, salty beer).",,1
138,Lambic,"A type of beer brewed in the Pajottenland region of Belgium southwest of Brussels and in Brussels itself since the 13th century. Types of lambic beers include gueuze, kriek lambic, and framboise. Lambic differs from most other beers in that it is fermented through exposure to wild yeasts and bacteria native to the Zenne valley, as opposed to exposure to carefully cultivated strains of brewer's yeast. This process gives the beer its distinctive flavour: dry, vinous, and cidery, often with a tart aftertaste.",,1

140,Imported,Beers available for consumption in the United States but produced in another country.,,1
141,Added Lactose,The incorporation of Lactose AKA milk sugars to make beer sweeter and provide a smoother mouthfeel. Lactose is not digestable by yeast during the fermentation process so can be incorporated in controlled amounts during the fermentation process without loosing sweetness or affecting the ABV of the brew.,,1
142,Sour Ale,"Unlike modern brewing, which is done in a sanitary environment to guard against the intrusion of wild yeast, historically the starter used from one batch to another usually contained some wild yeast and bacteria. Sours are made by intentionally allowing wild yeast strains or bacteria into the brew, traditionally through the barrels or during the cooling of the wort in a coolship open to the outside air. The most common microbes used to intentionally sour beer are the bacteria Lactobacillus and Pediococcus, while the fungus Brettanomyces can also add some acidity. Another method for achieving a tart flavor is adding fruit, which directly contributes organic acids such as citric acid. Additionally, acid can be directly added to beer or added by the use of unusually large amounts of acidulated malt. Depending on the process employed, the uncertainty involved in using wild yeast may cause the beer to take months to ferment and potentially years to mature. However, modern methods allow sour beer to be created within a typical timeframe for ales, usually several days.",,1
143,Saison,"A pale ale that is highly carbonated, fruity, spicy, and often bottle conditioned. It was historically brewed with low alcohol levels, but modern productions of the style have moderate to high levels of alcohol. Along with several other varieties, it is generally classified as a farmhouse ale.",,1
144,Gose,"A warm fermented beer that originated in Goslar, Germany. It is usually brewed with at least 50% of the grain bill being malted wheat. Dominant flavours in gose include a lemon sourness, a herbal characteristic, and a strong saltiness (the result of either local water sources or added salt).Gose beers typically do not have prominent hop bitterness, flavours, or aroma. The beers typically have a moderate alcohol content of 4 to 5% ABV. Because of the use of coriander and salt, gose does not comply with the traditional ingredient regulations in German-speaking countries, but it is allowed an exemption on the grounds of being a regional specialty. It acquires its characteristic sourness through inoculation with Lactobacillus bacteria.",,1
145,Dubbel,"A Belgian Trappist beer naming convention. The origin of the dubbel was a strong version of a brown beer brewed in Westmalle Abbey in 1856, which is known to have been on sale to the public by June 1861. Dubbels are characteristically known for being dark brown in colour with a strong flavour of dark fruit including raisins, prunes, and dates. These flavours and colours are almost entirely resultant from the heavy addition of highly caramelized (or kilned) beet sugar, which ferments completely into alcohol, lightening the body of the finished beer and contributing to its dry finish.",,1
146,Tripel,"A term used by brewers mainly in the Low Countries, some other European countries, and the U.S. to describe a strong pale ale, loosely in the style of Westmalle Tripel",,1
147,Quadrupel,"A type of beer, with an alcohol by volume of 9.1% to 14.2%. There is little agreement on the status of Quadrupel as a beer style. Writer Tim Webb notes that similar beers are called Grand Cru in Belgium even though the idea is derived from the Belgian beer naming convention of that uses numerical values descriptive of the number of prominent ingredients. In other countries, particularly the United States, quadrupel or quad has become a generic trademark. The term may refer to an especially strong style of dark ale with a spicy, ripe fruit flavor.",,1
148,Mead,"An alcoholic beverage made by fermenting honey mixed with water, and sometimes with added ingredients such as fruits, spices, grains, or hops. The alcoholic content ranges from about 3.5% ABV to more than 20%. The defining characteristic of mead is that the majority of the beverage's fermentable sugar is derived from honey.[5] It may be still, carbonated, or naturally sparkling; dry, semi-sweet, or sweet.",,1
149,Cider,"An alcoholic beverage made from the fermented juice of apples. The juice of most varieties of apple, including crab apples, can be used to make cider, but cider apples are best. The addition of sugar or extra fruit before a second fermentation increases the ethanol content of the resulting beverage. Cider alcohol content varies from 1.2% to 8.5% ABV or more in traditional English ciders, and 3.5% to 12% in continental ciders.",,1
150,Perry,"An alcoholic beverage made from fermented pears. Traditional perry making is broadly similar to traditional cider making, in that the fruit is picked, crushed, and pressed to extract the juice, which is then fermented using the wild yeasts found on the fruit's skin.",,1
